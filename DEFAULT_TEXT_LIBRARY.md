## Assessment Scope & Limitations

### SCOPE_DESCRIPTION
This assessment is based on a visual inspection and limited electrical testing of accessible areas only. It provides a framework for managing electrical risk within acceptable parameters.

### LIMITATIONS_DEFAULT
- This report is based on a visual inspection and limited electrical testing of accessible areas only.
- It does not constitute a comprehensive electrical audit or guarantee the absence of defects.

- All financial estimates are indicative only and not binding quotations.

## Thermal Imaging

### THERMAL_IMAGING_INTRO
Thermal imaging analysis provides a non-invasive method for identifying potential electrical issues that may not be visible during standard visual inspection.

### THERMAL_IMAGING_VALUE
This technology adds value to risk identification by detecting abnormal heat patterns that may indicate:
- Overloaded circuits or connections
- Loose or deteriorating electrical connections
- Potential failure points before they become critical

### THERMAL_IMAGING_NO_DATA
No thermal imaging data was captured for this assessment.

### THERMAL_IMAGING_NO_DATA_VALUE
Thermal imaging can provide additional value as a non-invasive decision support tool by identifying potential issues that may not be visible during standard visual inspection.

The observations and risk interpretations in this report are designed to help you challenge scope creep and ensure that any quotes you receive are aligned with the actual risk profile of the property.

### DECISION_PATHWAY_MANAGEMENT_PLAN
Delegate coordination, quotation review, and completion verification to a management plan (Standard or Premium). This option provides end-to-end management of electrical works, from contractor briefing through to quality assurance and compliance documentation. Contact the inspection provider for details on management plan options.
