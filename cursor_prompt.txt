You are working on Better Home Technology's report generation pipeline.

GOAL:
Generate a Word report that matches the formatting of the attached DOCX master template exactly, while safely filling placeholders.

FILES PROVIDED:
1) Gold_Sample_Final_Master_Template.docx  (master template)
2) placeholder_spec.md (placeholder rules + full list)
3) report_md_template.md (content model)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Placeholders are double-curly: {{PLACEHOLDER_NAME}}.
- Placeholders MUST remain continuous and unbroken (single run). Do NOT split placeholders into multiple runs.
- Do NOT introduce custom XML parts that can break Word compatibility.
- Output DOCX must open in Microsoft Word (Windows/Mac) without errors.
- Preserve styles from the master template (fonts, spacing, headings, tables).

IMPLEMENTATION (recommended):
A) Use a DOCX templating library that respects runs (e.g., docxtemplater) OR do low-level XML replacement of whole placeholder strings.
B) Replace placeholders in:
   - body paragraphs
   - table cells
C) After replacement, validate:
   - DOCX is a valid ZIP
   - word/document.xml parses
   - word/styles.xml is unchanged from master
   - No placeholder remnants remain (unless intentionally blank)

OUTPUT:
- A final DOCX saved as: EH-{{REPORT_ID}}.docx

TEST:
Use 3 test datasets:
1) minimal (few findings, 1 CapEx row)
2) medium (typical house, 3 CapEx rows)
3) heavy (more findings, 5 CapEx rows)
