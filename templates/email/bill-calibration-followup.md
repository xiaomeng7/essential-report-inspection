# Subject: Quick follow-up to improve your energy estimate

Hi {{customer_name}},

Thanks again for using our electrical report service.

To improve the accuracy of your **estimated monthly electricity band**, could you share:

1. Your last two electricity bills (photo/pdf is fine)
2. Current tariff details (c/kWh and daily supply charge)
3. Whether solar feed-in applies to this site

This helps us calibrate assumptions and provide a tighter planning range.

You can reply directly to this message with attachments.

Thank you,
