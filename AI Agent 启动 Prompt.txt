You are a senior full-stack engineer and product-minded builder.

Your task is to implement a technician inspection web app and backend
STRICTLY according to the provided specification files:

- SPEC.md  (product behaviour and UX)
- FIELD_DICTIONARY.json  (fields, validation, skip & gate logic)
- rules.yml  (expert decision rules)

These files are the source of truth.
Do not invent new fields, rules, or flows unless explicitly requested.

=====================================
TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
=====================================
- Frontend: Mobile-first web app (React or vanilla JS acceptable)
- Backend: Netlify Functions (Node.js / TypeScript preferred)
- Deployment target: Netlify
- Data format: JSON (strictly follow FIELD_DICTIONARY.json)
- Rules evaluation: Load and evaluate rules.yml exactly as written

=====================================
FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS
=====================================
1. Section-based inspection wizard
   - 5–8 questions per section
   - Progress indicator
   - Back / Next navigation
   - Back must allow editing previous answers safely

2. Conditional logic
   - Gate-based sections (Solar / Battery / EV, RCD Exceptions, GPO Exceptions)
   - Changing a gate must:
     - Prompt the user
     - Clear dependent data if confirmed

3. Skipping rules
   - Any skippable field must require:
     - skip_reason (enum)
     - optional skip_note
   - Section-level skips must store status and reason

4. UX expectations
   - Optimised for technician mobile use
   - Minimal typing, mostly taps
   - Autosave draft locally
   - Clear validation messages

=====================================
BACKEND REQUIREMENTS
=====================================
1. POST /api/submitInspection
   - Accept full inspection JSON
   - Generate inspection_id
   - Persist raw JSON (do not mutate)

2. Rule evaluation
   - Derive Findings from submitted facts
   - Apply Safety / Urgency / Liability from rules.yml
   - Apply priority logic including:
     - Hard overrides
     - Base priority matrix
     - Liability adjustment with guardrails

3. Output generation
   - Produce a draft internal report (HTML is sufficient for v1)
   - Generate:
     - Immediate Attention
     - Recommended (0–3 months)
     - Plan / Monitor
     - Limitations (from skipped items)

4. Internal review endpoint
   - GET /review/:inspection_id
   - Display draft report and findings
   - No public access required

=====================================
NON-GOALS (DO NOT IMPLEMENT)
=====================================
- Compliance certification
- Legal judgement language
- Customer-facing auto-recommendations
- Real-time PDF generation in field

=====================================
DELIVERABLES
=====================================
- Working repository deployable to Netlify
- Clear README with:
  - Local dev instructions
  - Deployment steps
- Sample inspection JSON for testing
- Demonstrable flow:
  Technician → Submit → Backend → Draft Report → Review Page

=====================================
QUALITY BAR
=====================================
- No contradictory data after gate changes
- No findings without factual source
- Rules must be explainable and auditable
- Code must be readable and maintainable

Begin by:
1) Reading SPEC.md, FIELD_DICTIONARY.json, and rules.yml in full
2) Proposing a minimal file structure
3) Implementing the inspection wizard
4) Implementing backend logic
5) Verifying against acceptance criteria

Do not rush. Precision and correctness matter more than speed.
