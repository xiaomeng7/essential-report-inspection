## Executive Summary

### Risk Level: 🟡 🔴 Elevated

This property presents a low electrical risk profile at the time of inspection.
No immediate safety hazards or compliance-critical issues were identified.
From a property owner or investor perspective,
no immediate capital expenditure is required,
and the electrical condition of the property is unlikely to impact tenancy, insurance, or near-term asset value.

A small number of non-urgent maintenance observations were noted. These do not require immediate action but should be addressed as part of routine property upkeep to maintain long-term reliability and compliance confidence.

### Executive Decision Signals

- If these 1 immediate concern are not addressed, they may escalate into more significant liability exposure or operational disruption over the next 6-12 months.
- While these items require attention, they do not represent an immediate emergency that would prevent continued use of the property under normal conditions.
- These risks can be managed within standard asset planning cycles, allowing for proper budgeting and contractor engagement without urgent disruption.

## Observed Conditions & Risk Interpretation

### 1. Men Link

#### Asset Component
Men Link

#### Observed Condition
Men Link was observed during the visual inspection.

#### Evidence
Visual inspection only

#### Risk Interpretation
Earthing and bonding are fundamental for correct operation of protective devices and reducing touch voltage risk.

If this condition is not addressed, it may pose immediate safety risks or escalate into significant liability exposure within the next 6-12 months.

#### Priority Classification
🔴 Urgent Liability Risk

#### Budgetary Planning Range
AUD $200 – $500 (indicative, planning only). Verification and testing

---

### 2. PARTIAL RCD COVERAGE

#### Asset Component
PARTIAL RCD COVERAGE

#### Observed Condition
Some circuits are protected by RCD devices, but not all circuits have RCD protection.

#### Evidence
Mixed protection types observed

#### Risk Interpretation
This condition may affect electrical safety, reliability, or maintainability depending on severity and location.

If this condition is not addressed, unprotected circuits may remain vulnerable to earth fault risks over time.

#### Priority Classification
🟡 Budgetary Provision Recommended

#### Budgetary Planning Range
AUD $800 – $2000 (indicative, planning only). Depending on number of circuits

---

### 3. LABELING POOR

#### Asset Component
LABELING POOR

#### Observed Condition
Circuit labels are missing, unclear, or outdated.

#### Evidence
Many breakers lack clear labels

#### Risk Interpretation
This condition may affect electrical safety, reliability, or maintainability depending on severity and location.

If this condition is not addressed, it may become more difficult to manage the electrical installation over time. This can be addressed during routine maintenance cycles.

#### Priority Classification
🟢 Acceptable

#### Budgetary Planning Range
AUD $100 – $300 (indicative, planning only). Professional labeling
