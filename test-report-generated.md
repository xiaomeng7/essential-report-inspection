## Executive Summary

### Risk Level: 🔴 HIGH RISK

This property presents a high electrical risk profile at the time of inspection.
One or more issues were identified that may pose safety, compliance, or operational
risks if left unaddressed. Immediate attention is recommended before continued use
or tenancy.
Failure to address these items may expose the owner to increased liability,
insurance complications, or service disruption.

### Executive Decision Signals

- If these 1 immediate concern are not addressed, they may escalate into more significant liability exposure or operational disruption over the next 6-12 months.
- While these items require attention, they do not represent an immediate emergency that would prevent continued use of the property under normal conditions.
- These risks can be managed within standard asset planning cycles, allowing for proper budgeting and contractor engagement without urgent disruption.

### Financial Planning Snapshot

**Estimated Capital Expenditure Range:** To be confirmed

## Assessment Scope & Limitations

### Scope

This assessment is based on a visual inspection and limited electrical testing of accessible areas only. It provides a framework for managing electrical risk within acceptable parameters.

### Limitations

- Underfloor space not accessible

### Access Information

- **Switchboard:** Accessible
- **Roof space:** Accessible
- **Underfloor:** Not accessible

## Observed Conditions & Risk Interpretation

### 1. MEN Link

#### Asset Component
MEN Link

#### Observed Condition
MEN link verification status could not be confirmed during visual inspection.

#### Evidence
MEN link verification status could not be confirmed during visual inspection.

#### Risk Interpretation
The MEN link is critical for electrical safety and must be verified by a licensed electrician.

If this condition is not addressed, the electrical installation may not have proper earth fault protection, which could pose a significant safety risk over time. This risk can be managed by engaging a licensed electrician for verification within normal planning cycles.

#### Priority Classification
🔴 Urgent Liability Risk

#### Budgetary Planning Range
AUD $200 – $500 (indicative, planning only). Verification and testing

---

### 2. Partial RCD Protection

#### Asset Component
Partial RCD Protection

#### Observed Condition
Some circuits are protected by RCD devices, but not all circuits have RCD protection.

#### Evidence
Some circuits are protected by RCD devices, but not all circuits have RCD protection.

#### Risk Interpretation
Incomplete RCD protection may leave some circuits vulnerable to earth fault risks.

If this condition is not addressed, unprotected circuits may remain vulnerable to earth fault risks over time. This can be factored into future capital planning cycles without immediate urgency.

#### Priority Classification
🟡 Budgetary Provision Recommended

#### Budgetary Planning Range
AUD $800 – $2000 (indicative, planning only). Depending on number of circuits

---

### 3. Circuit Labeling

#### Asset Component
Circuit Labeling

#### Observed Condition
Circuit labels are missing, unclear, or outdated.

#### Evidence
Circuit labels are missing, unclear, or outdated.

#### Risk Interpretation
Poor labeling makes it difficult to identify circuits during maintenance or emergencies.

If this condition is not addressed, it may become more difficult to manage the electrical installation over time. This can be addressed during routine maintenance cycles.

#### Priority Classification
🟢 Acceptable

#### Budgetary Planning Range
AUD $100 – $300 (indicative, planning only). Professional labeling
