  ALARM_SOUNDED:
    title: Alarm Sounded
    observed_condition:
      - Alarm Sounded was observed during the visual inspection.
    why_it_matters: Smoke alarms are critical life-safety devices; faults or non-compliance may reduce early warning in a fire event.
    priority_rationale: >-
      This condition does not present an immediate or urgent risk and can be monitored over time, allowing for strategic
      planning and budgeting.
    risk_interpretation: >-
      If this condition is not addressed over the next 3-5 years, it may gradually impact long-term reliability or
      compliance confidence. This risk can be managed within normal asset planning cycles, allowing for proper budgeting
      and contractor engagement without immediate urgency.
    planning_guidance: Schedule periodic testing and replacement in line with manufacturer guidance.
