identified during the assessment.

While no immediate safety hazards were identified, several items were noted that
require attention in the short to medium term to reduce future compliance or
reliability risks.

Planned maintenance is recommended to avoid escalation and to maintain confidence
in the property's ongoing electrical condition.
