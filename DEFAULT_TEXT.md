## Document Purpose & How to Read This Report

### Purpose of This Report
This report is an independent electrical asset risk assessment designed to support informed decision-making, financial planning, and long-term asset protection.

It is not a repair quote, not a compliance certificate, and not a statutory inspection report.

### How This Report Is Structured
This report follows a decision-support logic:
1. What was observed (facts)
2. What it means (risk interpretation)
3. What requires attention (priority)
4. What to plan for financially (CapEx outlook)
