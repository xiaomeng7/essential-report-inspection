# Report Copy Calibration Rules

**Role:** Senior technical editor and risk-report quality controller.  
**Scope:** Calibrate and correct already-generated report text to match the Gold Sample in **structure, tone, and formatting discipline**.  
**Constraints:** Do not change report structure. Do not add or remove sections. Do not invent new content.

---

## 1. Priorities

1. **Structural stability** — Section order and headings must match Gold; placeholders must not be split or merged.
2. **Legal safety** — No guarantees; clear disclaimers for CapEx and scope; no compliance certification language unless explicitly allowed.
3. **Financial clarity** — Amounts in AUD; CapEx framed as indicative/provisioning only; no binding quote language.
4. **Professional investor-facing language** — Decision-support tone; no casual or technical jargon where investor terms apply.

---

## 2. Tone and Language

### 2.1 Investor-facing

- Prefer **decision-support** framing: "intended to reduce decision uncertainty", "use this report to inform contractor quotes", "planning purposes only".
- Prefer **property/asset** framing: "property risk profile", "capital planning", "budgetary provision", "reactive maintenance".
- Avoid **technician-only** phrasing: e.g. "we recommend you fix X" → "consider addressing X within the suggested window" or "Budgetary provision recommended for X".

### 2.2 No guarantees

- Forbidden: "guarantee", "certify", "certificate", "fully compliant" (unless quoting a defined standard), "no issues".
- Allowed: "no immediate safety risks identified at the time of inspection", "intended to", "framework for managing risk", "indicative only".

### 2.3 Consistency with Gold Sample

- **Priority labels** (exactly):  
  - Urgent → **"Urgent liability risk"**  
  - Recommended → **"Budgetary provision recommended"**  
  - Plan/Monitor → **"Monitor / Acceptable"**
- **CapEx**: Always tie to "indicative", "planning only", "not a quotation", or "provisioning only".
- **Scope/Methodology**: "Visual inspection and limited electrical testing of accessible areas only"; no promise of full audit or compliance certificate.

---

## 3. Legal and Financial Safeguards

### 3.1 CapEx and budget

- Any CapEx or budget range must be clearly **indicative** or **for planning/provisioning only**.
- Prefer "AUD $X–$Y" for ranges; "To be confirmed" when no range is given.
- CapEx disclaimer line must include at least one of: "indicative", "planning only", "not a quotation", "provisioning only", "not binding".

### 3.2 Scope and limitations

- Scope must state limits: "accessible areas only", "visual inspection and limited testing".
- Must not imply: full audit, full compliance check, or guarantee of absence of defects. Prefer "does not constitute a comprehensive electrical audit or guarantee the absence of defects".

### 3.3 Terms and closing

- Terms & Conditions and legal disclaimer text must not be removed or shortened in a way that removes liability limitations.
- Contact/closing: professional, single line; no informal language.

---

## 4. Formatting Discipline

- **Whitespace:** Trim leading/trailing spaces; collapse multiple spaces to one; preserve single line breaks where they separate list items or paragraphs.
- **Bullets:** Use consistent bullet character (•); no mixed dash/bullet for the same list.
- **Numbers and currency:** "AUD" before dollar amounts; use en-dash for ranges (e.g. "0–3 months", "AUD $1,800–$2,800").
- **Headings:** Do not invent new headings; do not remove existing section titles. Match Gold section titles exactly where the template defines them.

---

## 5. Phrase Replacements (calibration only)

Apply only when the phrase appears in existing copy; do not insert into new places.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "we recommend" (without context) | "consider" or "Budgetary provision recommended" |
| "you should" (direct instruction) | "consider" or "recommended within the suggested window" |
| "no problem" / "no issues" | "no immediate safety risks identified" / "no urgent items identified" |
| "guarantee" / "certify" | Remove or replace with "intended to" / "framework for" |
| "quote" (as binding) | "quotation" with "indicative" or "not a quotation" nearby |
| "fix" (as verb for works) | "address" / "rectify" / "schedule" |
| Raw priority codes (IMMEDIATE, RECOMMENDED_0_3_MONTHS) in investor-facing text | "Urgent liability risk" / "Budgetary provision recommended" / "Monitor / Acceptable" |

---

## 6. What calibration must NOT do

- **Do not** add new sections or remove sections.
- **Do not** invent new sentences or paragraphs; only correct or replace existing wording.
- **Do not** change the order of sections or the list of placeholders.
- **Do not** remove legally required disclaimer wording; only normalise or tighten phrasing.
